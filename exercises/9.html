<h2>Exercise 9 - Absolute Value</h2>
<p>Read two positive numbers from the user.</p>
<p>Calculate the difference between them (the absolute value).</p>
<ul>
    <li>First, check that the input values are numbers (try googling something like ‘javascript check if number’)</li>
    <li>Print the inputs and the absolute difference between them to the console.</li>
    <li>If the difference is smaller than both input values, print a message to the console saying that those numbers are relatively close.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should look something like this – </p>

<p class="console">num1 = 5, num2 = 9, diff = 4 (numbers are relatively close!)</p>
<p class="console">num1 = 15, num2 = 89, diff = 74 </p>
