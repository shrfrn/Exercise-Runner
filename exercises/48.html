<h2>Exercise 48 - <span class="code">sortNums()</span></h2>
<p>
    Implement the function <span class="code">sortNums(nums)</span>. 
    This function returns a sorted version of the original nums array. 
    It works by looping through the array, finding the minimum, splicing it out, and adding it to a new array.

<p>Read about how to sort an array yourself, by using the bubble sort algorithm. Google it, copy it, adjust it to match our coding conventions and use it.</p>
