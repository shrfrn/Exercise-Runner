<h2>Exercise 41 - Digits to Words</h2>
<p>Write a function named sayNum(num) which prints each digit in words</p> 
<p> For example: </p>

<p><span class="console">123&nbsp; => One Two Three.</span></p>
<p><span class="console">7294 => Seven Two Nine Four.</span></p>

<p class="tip">Tip: You may use  switch  inside a loop or an array named digitNames. 
(Or maybeâ€¦ just try them both!)</p>
