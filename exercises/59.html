<h2>Exercise 59 - BINGO</h2>
<p>
    Your challenge is to implement the famous game of BINGO. 
    In this version of the game, there are two players. 
    Numbers are drawn at random, and each player marks the number if it appears in his board. 
    The first player to mark all the numbers on his board, wins.
</p>

<p>Here is the suggested data structure: </p>
    <pre class="code">
        var gPlayers = [
            {name: ‘Muki’, hitCount: 0, board: createBingoBoard()},
            {name: ‘Puki, hitCount: 0, board: createBingoBoard()}
        ]
    </pre>

<p>Every cell in board  will hold an object like <this:span class="code">{value: 17, isHit: false}</this:span></p>
<p>
    It is common practice to implement our code in several stages, 
    starting with simplified version for some of the functions, 
    which allow us to test other parts of our code first. 
    Let’s try this approach:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the <span class="code">createBingoBoard()</span> function:
            It returns a 5 by 5 matrix containing cell object as described above, 
            with the numbers <span class="console">1 – 25</span> (Later on we will change it to <span class="console">1 – 99</span>).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Implement the function <span class="code">printBingoBoard(board)</span> which prints the board by showing the number (value) in each cell.</p>
        <p>If  isHit is true, add 'v' to the printed number.</p>
        <p>
            Check your function by manually setting a cell's isHit to true like this: 
            <span class="code">gPlayers[0].board[0][0].isHit = true</span> and printing the board (remember you can run code from the console).
        </p>
        <p>Implement some empty (placeholder) functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="code">drawNum()</span> code a simple function returning a fixed number (e.g. 17)</li>
            <li><span class="code">markBoard()</span> an empty function for now.</li>
            <li><span class="code">checkBingo()</span> a simple function returning true (note, that if it returns false  it will cause an infinite loop).</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the <span class="code">playBingo</span> function:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">
            <button class="copy-play-bingo-func">Copy</button>
            <div class="play-bingo-msg"></div>
            <pre class="code play-bingo-func">
 function playBingo(){
    var isVictory = false

    while(!isVictory){
      var calledNum = drawNum()
      
      for(var i = 0; i &lt; gPlayers.length && !isVictory; i++){
        var player = gPlayers[i]
        markBoard(player, calledNum)
        isVictory = checkBingo(player)
      }
    }
  }        </pre>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="play-bingo-img"><img src="../assets/img/play_bingo_function.png" alt=""></div> -->
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the <span class="code">markBoard</span> function:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the board contains a cell with <span class="code">calledNum</span>  in its value, update that cell's <span class="code">isHit</span> value accordingly and increase the player’s <span class="code">hitCount</span> .</li>
            <li>Use the <span class="code">printBingoBoard</span> function to debug your function and make sure it works correctly.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the <span class="code">checkBingo</span> function – Just check if the player’s <span class="code">hitCount</span>  has reached 25.            
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the <span class="code">drawNum</span> function:                
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We will later need this function to return a unique random number, so we will use an array - <span class="code">gNums</span>.</li>
            <li>Add the function <span class="code">resetNums</span> which updates the global variable <span class="code">gNums</span> to be an array with the numbers 1 – 25. This function should be called at the beginning of <span class="code">createBoard</span> and also at the beginning of the <span class="code">playBingo</span> function.</li>
            <li>The function <span class="code">drawNum</span> can just pop from that array for now (predictable order helps while developing)</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Make sure you have a basic working game that ends after 25 iterations before moving on
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Implement the following additions and modification:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <span class="code">gNums</span> array should hold the numbers from 1 to 99.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <span class="code">drawNum</span> should return a random number from the array. Use splice for that, to make sure the drawn numbers do not repeat.
                </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Print a happy greeting when a player –
                </p>
            </li>
            <ol>
                <li>completes a row – ‘Muki has completed a row!’.</li>
                <li>completes the main diagonal – ‘Muki has completed the main diagonal!’</li>
                <li>completes the secondary diagonal – ‘Muki has completed the secondary diagonal!’.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Slow down the game so it feels more realistic and easy to follow:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use <span class="code">setInterval</span> instead of the while loop: <span class="code">var gameInterval = setInterval(playTurn, 1000)</span></li>
                    <li>Use <span class="code">clearInterval(gameInterval)</span> when the game is over.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Finalizing
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>How easy would it be to make your game to work with a 6 by 6 Bingo board?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>How easy would it be, to add more players?</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
