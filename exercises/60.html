<h2>Exercise 60 - Game of Life</h2>
<p>
    The Game of Life is a simulation of how a population of creatures evolves from 
    one generation to the next, based on a set of simple rules.
    This colony is described by a matrix of a user determined size, where each cell 
    is either populated by a creature (marked by an asterisk <span class="console">'*'</span>), or vacant. 
    As with any matrix, each cell can have 8 neighboring cells at the most.
</p>
<p>Start with a population of your choice, for example:</p>
<div class="game-of-life"><img src="../assets/img/game_of_life.png" alt=""></div>
<p>Here are the rules which govern the evolution of the colony:</p>
<ol>
    <li>if a creature has 0 – 2 neighboring creatures, it will die of loneliness and the cell which it occupies will become vacant in the next generation.</li>
    <li>if a cell has 3 – 5 occupied neighboring cells, it will have a creature in it in the next generation – either a newborn creature or the creature which previously occupied it.</li>
    <li>if a creature has 6 – 8 occupied neighboring creatures, it will suffocate and die, and the cell which it occupies will become vacant in the next generation.</li>
</ol>
<p class="tip">Tip: use  setInterval  to run a function which looks something like this:
    <pre class="tip">
        function play()
            gBoard = runGeneration(gBoard)	
            renderBoard(gBoard) 
        }
    </pre>
</p>					
<p class="tip">Tip: use a second matrix to generate the new generations of the colony so that you do not modify the current state of the colony while still calculating the next generation.</p>
