<h2>Exercise 43 - Sum Arrays</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Write the function  sumArrays  which receives two arrays and returns their sum.</p>
        <p>For example: <span class="console">[1, 4, 3] & [2, 5, 1, 9] => [3, 9, 4, 9]</span></p>
        <p class="tip">Tip: this can be done in a single loop by first identifying the shorter or longer array of the two.</p>
    </li>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <li>
        <p>Now, read these arrays from the user (until the number 999 is entered)</p>
        <p class="tip">Tip: write the function: getArrayFromUser and call it twice</p>
    </li>
</ol>
