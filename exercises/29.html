<h2>Exercise 29 - Digit Manipulation</h2>
<p>Read a number from the user (&nbsp;keep it as a string i.e. <span class="console">"24367"</span>) and then:</p>		
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p class="mb-xl">Basic operations:</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="mb-s">Print each of its digits in a separate line.</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Calculate the sum of its digits.</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Calculate the multiplication (מכפלה) of its digits.</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Sum its first and last digits.</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Print it with its first and last digits swapped.	 (<span class="console">2731</span> => <span class="console">1732</span>)</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Check whether it is symmetric.	 (&nbsp;like this number: <span class="console">95459</span>)</li>
            <li class="mb-s">Print the number reversed.</li>
            <li>BONUS: Print the number reversed as a number and not as string.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li class="mt-xl">
        <p class="mb-xl">BONUS: Special Numbers</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="mb-l">
                <p class="mb-l">Check if the number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is an integer, such that the sum of each of its digits, raised to a power equal to the number of its digits, is equal to the number itself.</p> 
                <p>For example: <span class="math">371</span>  is an Armstrong number, because  <span class="math">3&nbsp;&sup3;+7&nbsp;&sup3;+1&nbsp;&sup3; = 371</span>.</p>
                <p>Another example: <span class="math">548,834</span> is an Armstrong number, because  <span class="math">5&#8310;+4&#8310;+8&#8310;+8&#8310;+3&#8310;+3&#8310; = 548,834</span></p>
                <p class="mb-l mt-l">If the number passed the test, print it to the console.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="mb-xl">Check if the number is a Perfect number. A Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its divisors.
                For example:  <span class="math">6</span>  is a Perfect number <span class="math">(1+2+3)</span>.</li>
            <li>Read a number from the user and store it in a variable named  max. 
                Implement a function which will print all the Perfect numbers and all the Armstrong numbers that are smaller than  max. </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

</ol>
