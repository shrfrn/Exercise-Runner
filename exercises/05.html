<h2>Exercise 5 - Number from Digits</h2>
<p>Read 3 digits from the user, join them to one number and print it.</p>
<p>For example: if the user enters the digits 3, 2 and 6, we should store them in a variable holding the value <span class="code">'326'</span> and then print that variable to the console.</p>
